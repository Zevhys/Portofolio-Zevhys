# Exercise Portofolio
I have undertaken a practice project to create a portfolio, aimed at refining my web development skills. This portfolio, though not an authentic representation of my work, serves as an exercise to showcase my learning journey. It provides a glimpse into my proficiency and enthusiasm for crafting meaningful and visually appealing digital experiences.
